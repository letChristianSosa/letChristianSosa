### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Who I am?. My name is Christian Sosa. I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer trained in the Henry Bootcamp. I'm interested in working as a Full-Stack Developer, Frontend Developer or Backend Developer. I'm passionate about programming and I'm always in constant learning. I like to share my knowledge and learn from other people like a team. I like to resolve problems and I don't give up until the goal is complete. 

I currently have no work history. I have only my academic experience in Henry, six months of intense learning.

I have knowledge in the following technologies: 
HTML5
CSS / SASS / Bootstrap
JavaScript / TypeScript 
React 
Redux 
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
SQL.

I'm ready to work and learn all the necessary.
